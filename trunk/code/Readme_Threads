This readme file describes the basic usage, and assumptions made in the solutions to the problems of assignment

to build

1) untar the package using tar -xvf setty-anand.tar command
2) cd code
3) run make all
4) cd threads
5) run nachos with specific options for each problem

General Notes: 
1. solutions to all problems are present in Threads directory
2. and Threads/main.cc is changed to take the command line arguments for each problem
3. the executable nachos is linked with all the solutions

---------------------------------------------------------
prob-1) Implementation of locks and conditional variables
-----------------------------------------------------------

The implementation as desired is in synch.cc

--------------------------------------------------
prob-2) Producer consumer problem
--------------------------------------------------
Usage: nachos -bb <numproducers> <numconsumers>

Files: producerconsumer.cc and producerconsumer.h

Note: Producers produce 1 character at a time from the string Hello World infinitely
so if you want to stop the program then do the ctrl+c

sample Input/output

Usage: nachos -prof <numstudents>

Files: profstudentproblem.cc and profstudentproblem.h

Note: each student asks a question and gets the answer and goes back to ask another 
qeustion infinitely, so again to stop the program do the ctrl+c

prob-12) Whale problem
--------------------------------------------------

Usage: nachos -whales <nummalewhales> <numfemalewhales>

Files: whaleproblem.cc and whaleproblem.h

Notes: 
1. Each whale tries to become bride or groom first if it fails to get a chance
	then it attempts to become match maker
2. It is assumed that the match maker is one of the males and females and once
it finishes matching it goes back and contests for mating or match making again
3. So one whale can be match maker multiple times in its life time
4. Not every whale gets to mate. So in the end when there is no male female and match maker pair the progam exits

sample Input/output:
nachos -whales 3 4

Mating Counter:3 -Mating is taking place between the male whale 3       and female whale 3 and the match maker is: Female whale 4

prob-13) Professor student problem
--------------------------------------------------
Usage: nachos -boats <numcannibals> <nummissionaries>

Files: boatproblem.cc and boatproblem.h

Notes: 
1. The solution does not solve classical cannibal missionary problems, it only 
formulates the safe rowing in a greedy way
2. when there are not enough resources to row a boat, the nachos stops itself
